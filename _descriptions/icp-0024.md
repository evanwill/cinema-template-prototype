The Grand was opened by William Kay in 1913. 

### Post-Rising

The Grand closed definitively on 24 April 1916, the only cinema, somewhat remarkably, completely destroyed during the Easter Rising. "All that is left to view of the Grand," the _Kinematograph and Lantern Weekly_ reported, "is the shattered remains of the operaing box. The front wall of this has vanished, disclosing to the gaze of passers-by a burnt and twisted mass of metal (formerly a projector), and, on the side nearest the theatre, the two aperatures through which the pictures where thrown." Kay would subsequently take up management of the Rotunda, moving his Grand orchestra there and displacing the Irish Ladies String Orchestra.
