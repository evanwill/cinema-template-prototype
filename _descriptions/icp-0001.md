A lapse in the Queen's Royal Theatre's patent in 1908 allowed the premises on what was then Great Brunswick Street to house Dublin's and Ireland's first full-time year-round film venue. The building was hired by the Colonial Picture Combine, which had been touring through Britain and Ireland with its headline act, the Australian proto-feature The Story of the Kelly Gang (Tait, 1906). They spent Christmas week 1907 at the Alhambra in Sandgate, and when they arrived at the Queen's, they no doubt planned a short stay, such as they had at Belfast's Ulster Hall from 13-25 April 1908. Finding the venue available and the audiences enthusiastic, however, they stayed in Dublin for nearly a year, from 2 March 1908 to 9 January 1909.
