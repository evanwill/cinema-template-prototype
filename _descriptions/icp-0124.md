Kells’s first cinema was started by James Carroll, a grocer and auctioneer with a shop on New Market Street. That premises is on the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage. The cinema was located on Market Yard, behind the shop. Carroll was used to publicizing his activities and kept the cinema on the pages of the Meath Chronicle as it established itself in the public attention.
