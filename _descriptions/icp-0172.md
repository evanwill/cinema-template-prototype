With little prior fanfare, the Rinn cinema opened on 13 November 1925 at 23 Fitzwilliam Street in the Dublin suburb of Ringsend. “Built at a cost of £10,000 and furnished at great expense, the house presented a fine appearance,” the Evening Herald noted, for its first audience of invited guests, including members of the Pembroke urban district council. The first evening’s feature film That Devil Quenado (US: Robertson-Cole, 1925) shared the bill with singing by ex-members of the Carl Rosa opera company, comedy from Cathal McGarvey and dancing.
