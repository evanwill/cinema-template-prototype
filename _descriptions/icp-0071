As with many Irish towns, the town hall was where many Sligo people first saw moving pictures, when in January 1897, Belfast electrical engineer C.C. McCarthy gave a lecture and exhibition of "Inventions of the Nineteenth Century" that included lantern slides, a cinematograph, a phonograph and X-rays. 

Even after the establishment of regular film exhibition at the Gillooly Hall (1911), the Sligo Picture Theatre (1911) and the Rink Picture Palace (1913), the Town Hall would continue to host travelling film shows from such impresarios as John Toft and J.T. Jameson for many years.
