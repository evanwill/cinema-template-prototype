With a population of 2,116 in 1911, Bundoran was a Victorian seaside resort that attracted tourists to the northwest Atlantic for a brief summer season, and the travelling show people who provided them with entertainment in local halls and temporary premises. Some of the latter seem to have longer residencies before a purpose-built cinema was constructed. Names associated with the town include such well-known travelling showmen as Bracey Daniells and John Monson.
